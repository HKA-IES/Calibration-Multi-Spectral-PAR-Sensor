## Installation

To reproduce the analysis, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Multi-Spectral-PAR-Sensor.git
cd PATH/your-repo-name/src
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Consider to use an own environment.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Use the raw measurement data in the `/data` directory or place there your input data files. Ensure the data format matches the requirements of the library.

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open `Calibration_Execution.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.
   - Follow the steps in the notebook to load the data, apply the calibration functions from `Calibration.py`, and view the results.

3. **Output**:
   - The results of the calibration will be displayed in the notebook and saved to an output file in the `/data` directory.
